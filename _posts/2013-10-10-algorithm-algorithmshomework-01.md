1 . Prove that each of the following sorting algorithms is stable or show that it is unstable by giving a counter example; moreover, determine whether it is in place: bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, heap‐sort.

2 . Given a positive integer n, design an algorithm for computing .

3 . How to implement merge‐sort such that the extra space used is about n/2 where n is the number of input elements?

4 . Design a data structure to represent a set with elements being positive integers, and then design algorithms for the following operations:
- Compute the union of two sets.
- Compute the intersection of two sets.
- Determine if a given element is in a given set.

5 . Given two sorted arrays x[1]…x[m], y[1]…y[n], design an algorithm to compute min i, j | x[i]− y[j]|.

6 . Solve the recurrence T(n)=2T(n/2)+n‐1 where n=2k is assumed. And assume that T(n) is constant if n<=2.

7 . Given a sorted integer array A[1..n], design an efficient algorithm to find an index i such that A[i]= i if i exists.
