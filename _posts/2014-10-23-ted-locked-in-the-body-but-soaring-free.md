Kitra Cahana: My father, locked in his body but soaring free 

> Few of us will ever have to face physical limitations to the degree that my father has, but we will all have moments of paralysis in our lives.

> I know I frequently confront walls that feel completely unscalable, but my father insists that there are no dead ends.

> Instead, he invites me into his space of co-healing to give the very best of myself, and for him to give the very best of himself to me.
