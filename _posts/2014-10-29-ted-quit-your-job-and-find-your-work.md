John Scherer - Quit Your Job and Find Your Work

> { The story of The Dragon Lady }

> Go for "tov"

> If you leave and another name goes in that box, the music will be different.

> Tov is when what you're doing is a full expression of who you are at the core of your being.

> Every day that you go to work, just ask yourself, "What's the lesson here? What is this for me?" Instead of saying, "I wonder why this happened to me?"
