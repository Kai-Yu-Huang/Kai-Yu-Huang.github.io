The Lottery: How can a ritual like the lottery continue to be held year after year? Why does no one move to end it? Is it only about harvest of crops or might any other reasons be involved? 

I think this is because there are indifference and selfishness between people. In the story, Mrs. Adams once said “Some places have already quit lotteries.” This means that she has felt confused about the meaning of the lottery and suspected the justification of the ritual. But she still threw stones to Mrs. Hutchinson instead of telling other people that something wrong. Some people may feel strange that why she does it even if she knows that it is wrong and cruel. Maybe we can say that it all comes from human’s selfishness and people don’t want to be different from others. Because once someone doubts something which is accepted by most of people, people will blame him and don’t keep in touch with him. So most of people will comply with the “rules” silently even if they don’t agree about those. Just for avoiding feeling left out from the group or community. As a result, people become indifferent and just watch some injustice happen. Maybe they would say “It’s not my business.” “This is not what I do.” They don't care about the person but only care about their future. That means everyone live in the dark, and no one has enough courage to fight fear. That is main reason I think that the lottery continue to be held year after year.
