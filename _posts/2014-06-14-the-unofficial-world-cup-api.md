配合 2014 年 FIFA 世界盃足球賽，來點相關的內容 XD

[The (un)official World Cup API](http://www.kimonolabs.com/worldcup/explorer)

> Structured data gives you the power to ask interesting questions. Quick want to find out **which team has scored the most goals**? Or **which player**? Wondering who are the **youngest players** participating in the cup? What about the **nicknames of the entire Brazilian team**? We also have historical data for each player so you can look up who's coming in with the **most regular season goals** or alternatively, the **most red cards**. What questions do you have?
