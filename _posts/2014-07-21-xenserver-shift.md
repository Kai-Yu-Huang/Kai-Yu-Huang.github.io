[Cheat Sheet](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Setting%20up%20Xen%20and%20XAPI%20(XenAPI)%20on%20Ubuntu%20Server%2012.04%20LTS%20and%20Managing%20it%20With%20Citrix%20XenCenter%20or%20OpenXenManager)

Install OpenXenManager

Remote desktop from mac to ubuntu

Just tunnel your X11 session over ssh. Nice and fast - because you're sending drawing commands, etc. Not whole bitmaps.

    ssh -X user@hostname (or ip address)

And then just type the name of a program, eg:

    openxenmanager

You can run a whole desktop as well.
