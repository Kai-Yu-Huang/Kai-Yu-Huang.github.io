A Clean, Well-Lighted Place: Do you think young people in Taiwan might feel "nada"? Some factors can help you argue your points: economic, educational, or political situations. 

In this rapidly changing generation, everything is unstable and unpredictable. In Taiwan, junior high school students is facing   the education reform nowadays. But the educational institutions don't do it well. Many students don't know how to prepare the tests and how to choose their school, and they will feel "nada". In political situations, maybe someone would said it is China, which is a dangerous country and often be unfriendly to us, that we will feel "nada" and desperate. But I think there are other bigger factor. For example, on the "Sunflower Movement", students wants to send Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement back and wish the government to reconsider the agreement. But we can see that the government faces it in a p assive   attitude and attempts to overwhelm students and social groups. It is disappointing, and it causes "nada". It's another season of graduation. Graduates get degrees joyfully,but they feel anxiety at the same. Because of high unemployment, depressed economic, and the weak government, they will feel "nada". Maybe I am the one of them, who feel "nada" and at a loss for the future. But I know I shall be responsible for myself, and it's not a good manner to blame someone or something all the time. Just be honest and diligent, I think.
