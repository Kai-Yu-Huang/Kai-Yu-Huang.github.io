  <section class="post-content"><p>3.1</p>

<p>Describe the differences among short term, medium term and long term sheduling?</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>Short-term scheduler is invoked very frequently (milliseconds) ⇒ (must be fast)”</p>

<p>Long-term scheduler is invoked very infrequently (seconds, minutes) ⇒ (may be slow)”</p>

<p>3.2</p>

<p>Describe the actions taken by a kernel to switch between processes?</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>the system must save the state of the old process and load the saved state for the new process via a context switch.</p>

<p>3.3</p>

<p>Ans:(none)</p>

<p>3.4</p>

<p>Explain the role of the init process on unix and linux system in regard to process termination?</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>init is the parent of all processes. Its primary role is to create processes from a script stored in  the file /etc/inittab.</p>

<p>init is the first process started during booting of the computer system</p>

<p>3.5</p>

<p>Including the initial parent process, how many process are created by the program shown in Figure 3.31?</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main() {
	int i;
  
  for ( i = 0 ; i &lt; 4 ; i++ ) {
      fork();
  }
  
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>1+4+3+2+1 = 11</p>

<p>3.6</p>

<p>Ans:(none)</p>

<p>3.7</p>

<p>Using the program in Figure 3.29, identify the values of pid at lines A, B, C and D. (Assume that the actual pids of the parent and child are 2600 and 2603, respectively.)</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; 
 
int main () 
{
    /* fork a child process */ 
    pid = fork(); 
    if ( pid &lt; 0 ) { /*error occurred 
        fprintf(stderr, “Fork Failed”); 
        return 1; 
    } 
    else if (pid ==0) { /* child process */ 
        pid1 = getpid(); 
        printf(“child: pid = %d” ,pid); /* A */ 
        printf(“child: pid1 = %d” ,pid1); /* B */ 
    } 
    else { /* parent process */ 
        pid1 = getpid(); 
        printf(“parent: pid = %d” ,pid); /* C */ 
        printf(“parent: pid1 = %d” ,pid1); /* D */ 
        wait(NULL); 
    } 
    return 0; 
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>A: 0, B: 2603, C: 2603, D: 2600</p>

<p>3.8</p>

<p>Give an example of a situation in which ordinary pipes are more suitable than named pipes and an example of a situation in which named pipes are more suitable than ordinary pipes?</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>ordinary pipes:</p>

<p>ordinary pipes require parent-child relationship between communicating processes.</p>

<p>ordinary pipes are unidirectional (producer-consumer style).</p>

<p>named pipes:</p>

<p>No parent-child relationship is necessary between the communicating processes.</p>

<p>named pipes is bidirectional.</p>

<p>3.9</p>

<p>Consider the RPC mechanism. Describe the undesirable circumstances that could arise from not enforcing either the “at most once” or “exactly once” semantics. Describe possible uses for a mechanism that had neither of these guarantees.</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>If an RPC mechanism could not support either the “at most once” or “at least once” semantics, then the <strong>RPC server cannot guarantee that a remote procedure will not be invoked multiple occurrences</strong>. Consider if a remote procedure were <strong>withdrawing money</strong> from a bank account on a system that did not support these semantics. It is possible that a single invocation of the remote procedure might lead to multiple withdrawals on the server. For a system to support either of these semantics generally requires the server maintain some form of client state such as the timestamp.</p>

<p><strong>If a system were unable to support either of these semantics</strong>, then such a <strong>system could only safely provide remote procedures that do not alter data or provide time-sensitive results</strong>. Using our bank account as an example, we certainly require “at most once” or “at least once” semantics for performing a withdrawal (or deposit!) However, an inquiry into an account balance or other account information such as <strong>name, address, etc. does not require these semantics</strong></p>

<p>3.10</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>Line X : 0, -1, -2, -3, -4
Line Y : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4</p>

<p>3.11</p>

<p>What are the benefits and the disadvantages of each of the following? Consider both the system level and the programmer level.</p>

<p>a. Synchronous and asynchronous communication</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>A benefit of <strong>synchronous communication</strong> is that it allows a rendezvous between the sender and receiver. A disadvantage of a <strong>blocking</strong> send is that a rendezvous may not be required and the message could be delivered asynchronously. As a result, message-passing systems often provide both forms of synchronization.</p>

<p>Synchronous =&gt; blocking</p>

<p>asynchronous =&gt; nonblocking</p>

<p>b. Automatic and explicit buffering</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p><strong>Automatic</strong> buffering provides <strong>a queue with indefinite length</strong>, thus <strong>ensuring the sender will never have to block while waiting to copy a message</strong>. There are no specifications on how automatic buffering will be provided; one scheme <strong>may reserve sufficiently large memory where much of the memory is wasted</strong>. <strong>Explicit buffering</strong> <strong>specifies how large the buffer is</strong>. In this situation, the <strong>sender may be blocked while waiting for available space in the queue</strong>. However, it is less likely that memory will be wasted with explicit buffering.</p>

<p>c. Send by copy and send by reference</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>Send by copy does not allow the receiver to alter the state of the parameter.
Send by reference does allow it.</p>

<p>A benefit of send by reference is that it allows the programmer to write a distributed version of a centralized application. Java’s RMI provides both; however, passing a parameter by reference requires declaring the parameter as a remote object as well.</p>

<p>d. Fixed-sized and variable-sized messages</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>The implications of this are mostly related to buffering issues; with fixed-size messages, a buffer with a specific size can hold a known number of messages. The number of variable-sized messages that can be held by such a buffer is unknown.</p>
