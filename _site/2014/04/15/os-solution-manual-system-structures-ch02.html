  <section class="post-content"><p>2.1</p>

<p>The service and functions provided by an operating system can be divided into two main tags. Briefly describes the two tags and discuss how they differ.</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p><strong>One class</strong> of services provided by an operating system is to <strong>enforce protection between different processes running concurrently in the system</strong>. <strong>Processes are allowed to access only those memory locations that are associated with their address spaces</strong>. Also, processes are not allowed to corrupt files associated with other users. <strong>A process is also not allowed to access devices directly without operating system intervention</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The second class</strong> of services provided by an operating system is to <strong>provide new functionality that is not supported directly by the underlying hardware</strong>. <strong>Virtual memory</strong> and <strong>file systems</strong> are two such examples of new services provided by an operating system.</p>

<p>2.2</p>

<p>Describe three general methods for passing parameters to the operating system.</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>Register, Block, Stack</p>

<ol>
  <li>pass the parameters in registers</li>
  <li>Parameters stored in a block,or table,in memory,and address of block passed as a parameter in a register</li>
  <li>Parameters placed,or pushed, onto the stack by the program and popped off the stack by the operating system</li>
</ol>

<p>2.3</p>

<p>Describe how you could obtain a statistical profile of the amount of time spent by a program executing different sections of its code. Discuss the importance of obtaining such statistical profile.</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>One could <strong>issue periodic timer interrupts</strong> and <strong>monitor what instructions or what sections of code are currently executing when the interrupts are delivered</strong>. A statistical profile of which pieces of code were active should be <strong>consistent with the time spent by the programin different sections of its code.</strong></p>

<p>Once statistical profile has been obtained, the programmer could<strong>optimize those sections of code that are consuming more of the CPU resources.</strong></p>

<p>http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Describe_how_you_could_obtain_a_statistical_profile_of_the_amount_of_time_spent_by_a_program_executing_different_sections_of_its_code?#slide=7</p>

<p>2.4</p>

<p>What are the five major activities of an operating system with regard to file management?</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>The creation and deletion of files</p>

<p>The creation and deletion of directories</p>

<p>The support of primitives for manipulating files and directories （open, close, read, write, reposition）</p>

<p>The mapping of files onto secondary storage</p>

<p>The backup of files on stable (nonvolatile) storage media</p>

<p>2.5</p>

<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the same system-call interface for manipulating both files and devices?</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p><strong>Each device can be accessed as though it was a file in the filesystem</strong>. Since most of the kernel deals with devices through this file interface,it is relatively easy to add a new device driver by implementing the hardware-specific code to support this abstract file interface. Therefore,t<strong>his benefits the development of both user program code, which can be written to access devices and files in the same manner</strong>, and device driver code, which can be written to support a well-defined API.</p>

<p><strong>The disadvantage with using the same interface</strong> is that <strong>it might be difficult to capture the functionality of certain devices within the context of the file access API</strong>, <strong>thereby either resulting in a loss of functionality or a loss of performance</strong>. Some of this could be overcome by the use of ioctl operationthat provides a general purpose interface for processes to invokeoperations on devices.</p>

<p>2.6</p>

<p>Would it be possible for the user to develop a new command intepreter using the system-call interface provided by the operating system</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>be able to develop a new command interpreter using the system-call interface provided by the operating system. <strong>The command interpreter allows an user to create and manage processes and also determine ways by which they communicate (such as through pipes and files).</strong> As all of this functionality could be accessed by an user-level program using the system calls, so it should be possible for the user to develop a new command-line interpreter.</p>

<p>2.7</p>

<p>What are the two models of interprocess communication? what are the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches?</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>One is <strong>message-passing model</strong> and the other is <strong>shared-memory model</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Message-passing strengths and weaknesses</strong>: <strong>message can be exchanged between the processes either directly or indirectly through a common mailbox</strong>. it is userful for exchanging smaller amounts of data and easier to implement for intercomputer communication. however,<strong>its speed is slower than shared-memory model</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Shared-memory strengths and weaknesses</strong>: it <strong>allows maxmum speed and convenience of communication</strong>. however,<strong>in the areas of protection and synchronization between the processes some problems exist</strong>.</p>

<p>2.8</p>

<p>Why is the separation of mechanism and policy desirable? </p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>The separation of mechanism and policy is important to <strong>provide flexibility to a system</strong>. If the interface between mechanism and policy is well defined, <strong>the change of policy may affect only a few parameters</strong>. On the other hand, if interface between these two is vague or not well defined, it might involve much deeper change to the system.</p>

<p>Mechanism and policy must be separate to ensure that systems <strong>are 
easy to modify</strong>.</p>

<p>2.9</p>

<p>It is sometimes difficult to achieve a layered approach if two components of the operating system are dependent on each other. Identify a scenario in which it is unclear how to layer two system components that require tight coupling of their functionalities.</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>The <strong>virtual memory subsystem</strong> and the <strong>storage subsystem</strong> are typically tightly coupled and require careful design in a layered system due to the following interactions.</p>

<p>Many <strong>systems allow files to be mapped into the virtual memory space of an executing process</strong>. <strong>On the other hand, the virtual memory subsystem typically uses the storage system to provide the backing store for pages that do not currently reside in memory.</strong></p>

<p>Also, updates to the file system are sometimes buffered in <strong>physical memory</strong> before it is <strong>flushed to disk</strong>, thereby requiring <strong>careful coordination of the usage of memory between the virtual memory subsystem and the file system</strong>.</p>

<p>2.10</p>

<p>What are the main advantages of the microkernel approach to system design?</p>

<p>How do user programs and system services interact in a microkernel architecture?</p>

<p>What are the disadvantages of using the microkernel approach?</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>Beneﬁts typically include the following (a) adding a new service does <strong>not require modifying the kernel</strong>, (b) it is <strong>more secure</strong> as <strong>more operations are done in user mode than in kernel mode</strong>, and (c) a <strong>simpler</strong> kernel design and functionality typically results in a <strong>more reliable</strong> operating system.</p>

<p>User programs and system services could interact through <strong>message passing</strong> or <strong>shared memory</strong> .</p>

<p>the disadvantages is : suffer from <strong>performance decreases</strong> due to <strong>increased system function overhead</strong> (context switching increased).</p>

<p>What are the advantages of using loadable kernel modules?</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>Each is <strong>loadable as needed</strong> within the kernel with <strong>more flexible</strong></p>

<p>2.12</p>

<p>How are iOS and Android similar, How are they different?</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>the main similarities are: Android and iOS are <strong>both operating systems for mobile devices</strong>. They are <strong>both programmed in C and C++</strong>.</p>

<p>the differences are: <strong>Android is an open-source</strong> OS and <strong>iOS is a closed source</strong> OS.</p>

<p>ios is based on Mac OS X kernel.</p>

<p>android is based on Linux kernel.</p>

<p>Explain why java programs running on android systems do not use the standard java api and virtual machine?</p>

<p>Ans:</p>

<p>android api, Dalvik VM</p>

<p>2.14</p>
